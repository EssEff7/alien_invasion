# alien_invasion
Alien Invasion project from the Python Crash Course book.

I am a beginner following the Python Crash Course book, this is my first "large" project and my first time using git.  
I am uploading the project on here to track my own progress as a programmer.

I had some issues with .gitignore folder not excluding files. So my first few commits are a bit sloppy. 
The issue was remedied and all was smooth sailing from there as far as git goes.

I ran into many snags making this simple 2-D game but each one forced me into a deeper understanding of the code, which was excellent.
I even had the opportunity to harness the power of git and went back to a previous commit after making some indentation mistake which was causing the screen to go black.
Being able to go back to a previous commit when the game funtioned was amazing and saved me probably hours of annoying work trying to fix the code. 
Having that ability allowed me to easier troubleshoot the issue and move on with the project. 

Looking forward to levelling up my skills even further into larger projects after finishing the PCC book. 

After finishing the book version of the game I added some of my own features:
- New background images to show the earth and space
- New alien and spaceship images with transparent backgrounds
- Sound effects and background music
- "Hall of fame" top 5 scores. Have user enter name if in the top 5.
